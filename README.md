# XmegaFun
Accumulated Atmel ATxmega reference code (small examples and old deprecated projects)

These are some older projects and code snippets for use as reference.
They will not be further developed (if I find something horrible I might change it, but for the most part it's as is).

Some projects are Atmel Studio based, some are accompanied by a Makefile and the rest are just plain C.

**basic** contains some example code for peripherals.
**at45-spi-dataflash** contains a small data logger project that uses a at45 dataflash chip (from atmel).
**SkyTraq-GPS** contains a SkyTraq binary protocol parses for use with a SkyTraq GPS module.
**bldc** contains two unfinished BLDC drivers. 
One sensor less for use with back EMF and one with standard Hall sensors, but it's outputs a sine wave (for use with a custom PCB).
